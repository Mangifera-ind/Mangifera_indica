            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>
                The management of a travelling website involves maintaining and updating the website's content,
                improving user experience and functionality, ensuring website security and data privacy,
                and increasing website traffic and engagement. This includes managing bookings, customer queries,
                and online payment systems. In addition, the website manager must stay up-to-date with travel industry trends,
                competitors, and regulations to ensure compliance and optimize business performance.
                Effective management requires a strong understanding of website development and maintenance, digital marketing,
                data analysis, and customer service.
